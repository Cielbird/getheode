# Geþeode phonotactics

Phonotactics are the rules for how [phonemes](../phoneme/README.md) can be arranged.


## Formatting

Phonotactic productions are written with Getheode's GBNF format.

Example:

```
<term_1> ::= <term_2>aeiou
```

Comments can be added with `#`

```
# This line is ignored
```
