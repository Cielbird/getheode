## getheode-gen
generates random words according to a lect

```
getheode gen <lect> <count> [-s|--surface]
```

each word is surrounded by slashes (`/example/`), representing phonemes, 
or with brackets (`[example]`) if `-s` is given

### `<lect>`
    expects a .geth file, conforming to getheode's yaml structure.
### `<count>`
    the number of words to generate. must be between 0 and 99, inclusively
### `-s`, `--surface`
    if given, the output will be the surface representation of the words.
